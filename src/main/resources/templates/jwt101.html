<h2>Why Are JWTs Important?</h2>
<p>They handle some of the problems with information passed from a client to a server. JWT allows the server to

<h2>What Is A JWT?</h2>
<p>Before we get started, letâ€™s quickly look at what a JWT contains so we can clearly understand why these best practices
    are important. In its most simple form, JWT has three distinct parts that are URL encoded for transport:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Header:</strong> The header contains the metadata for the token and at a minimal contains the type of the signature and/or encryption algorithm</li>
    <li><strong>Claims:</strong> The claims contains any information that you want signed</li>
    <li><strong>JSON Web Signature (JWS):</strong> The headers and claims digitally signed using the algorithm in the specified in the header</li>
</ul>
<p>The header and claims are JSON that are base64 encoded for transport. The header, claims, and signature are appended together with a period character <code>.</code><br />
    For example, if the header and claims are:</p>
